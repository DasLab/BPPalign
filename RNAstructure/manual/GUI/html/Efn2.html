    <h3>Efn2 (Energy Function 2)</h3>

    <p>This module provides energy calculations for a structure, given its CT file. When calculating the energy of structures in a CT file, the OUT file lists the structure number followed by the calculated energy. <strong>NOTE that efn2 does not support structures with pseudoknots.</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Click the button labeled "CT File." A dialog box will open to get the name of a CT file.</li>
      <li>A default name is provided for the OUT file. This can be changed by clicking the "OUT File" button.</li>
      <li>If desired, the temperature can be changed. (See "<a href=Tips_and_Techniques.html>"Tips and Techniques.</a>")</li>
      <li>Press the "Start" button.</li>
      <li>The OUT file is written as a plain text file that can be opened with any text editor.</li>
      <li>A more detailed OUT file, describing the energies within structures, can be created by checking the "Create Thermodynamic Details File" box.</li>
    </ol>
